HOW TO INSTALL SOSA WEB

You will need MySQL, PHP, Apache2 and a mail server is installed.
Additionally
	* You will need to ensure that you can write to directories wherever you have placed the source for uploading images.
	* You will need to ensure that MySQLi is installed and enabled with your mysqli installation
	* You will need to install or be running a mail-server that is configured properly with your PHP installation so that the native "mail()" functions work.

1. First, clone the source ZIP/repository into the whatever directory you want to access the project from.
	For example, 
	apache2 on ubuntu webroot default: /var/etc/www
	XAMPP windows webroot default: c:/xampp/htdocs 
	
2. Assuming you have already taken care of installing mysql server, run the SQL_INSTALL script on your database.
 
3. Edit /api/config.php/ within the project folder
	At this point you need to configure the database settings so PHP can interface with MySQL using the MySQLi adapter. 
	Change all constants prefixed with DB_ to match your own environment.
	You can also change the logged-in session length from here, in MINUTES.
